The partners for this project are Kristina Delvallee and Judith Moya.  A record of our meetings will be kept here.

During demo on 22/6/2020, Randy went over the Tower of Hanoi game and gave a basic outline for what to do.  I followed along to help create the project.  The CSS is ironed out for the most part and now we only need to work on the JS file for the assessment.

Meeting One:  22/6/2020 09:15 - Met on zoom to discuss the plan of action for the project.  Set time for second meeting to complete CSS for the project.
